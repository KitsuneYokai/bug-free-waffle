# Welcome to Bug-Free-Waffle!

Bug-free-Waffle is a private Osu! server listing page.

It is currently in development (and also lacking a name).

You can check the TODO´s list to check what's working and what isn't.

There is a test instance running24/7 @ https://osulistdev.kitsu.cf that can be used.

- Maybe add a user page?

## Notes

replace 'import discord' in your quart.discord.client with 'import nextcord as discord'. Access it by pressing CRTL + Left click on the 
import in waffle.py (quart_discord) and click again on .client
