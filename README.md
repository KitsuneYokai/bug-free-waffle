# Welcome to Bug-Free-Waffle!

Bug free waffle is a private osu server listing page.

I will write more here in a few days.

## TODO's

- [✔️] Register server

- [✔️] Edit server

- [  ] Write review

- [✔️] Vote (users can vote every 12h)

- [✔️] Load servers by votes from database & display on index

- [  ] API route to get the voted server from the user

- [✔️] Database(MySQL)

- [  ] Optimize templates

- [✔️] Templates (mostly done i think)

- [✔️] Add msg to forms, so the user knows when the server is registered/voted ...

- [  ] Add Dashboard/vote/review button to navbar

- [✔️] Add favicon & votes from the server to the servercards

- [  ] Add hCaptcha

- [✔️] Login

## Ideas
 - Add the serverteam member's to the serverpage
 - Add social media buttons
 - add discord bot to vote through the discord server
 - Maybe add a userpage?

Have an idea or a name for the project?
