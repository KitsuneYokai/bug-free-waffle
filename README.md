# Welcome to Bug-Free-Waffle!

Bug free waffle is a private osu server listing page.

I will write more here in a few days.

## TODO's

- [x] Register server

- [X] Edit server

- [ ] Write review

- [X] Vote (have to write vote.py to deleat votes after x h from the database)

- [x] Load servers by votes from database & display on index

- [ ] API route to get the voted server from the user

- [x] Database(MySQL)

- [ ] Optimize templates

- [X] Templates (mostly done i think)

- [X] Add msg to forms, so the user knows when the server is registered/voted ...

- [ ] Add Dashboard/vote/review button to navbar

- [X] Add favicon & votes from the server to the servercards

- [ ] Add hCaptcha

- [X] Login

## Ideas
 - Add the serverteam member's to the serverpage
 - Add social media buttons
 - add discord bot to vote through the discord server
 - Maybe add a userpage?

Have an idea or a name for the project?
